# Repository Evolution & Cleanup History

## 📋 Overview

This document tracks the evolution of the Datto RMM PowerShell Scripts repository from traditional script development to the current GitHub-based function library architecture with enhanced documentation.

## 🔄 Major Architectural Changes

### **Phase 1: Traditional Script Development (Original)**
- Individual PowerShell scripts in root directory
- Basic documentation guides
- Manual script maintenance

### **Phase 2: GitHub Function Library Architecture**
- Implemented shared-functions/ directory
- Added launcher-based deployment
- Organized components by Datto RMM categories
- Enhanced error handling and caching

### **Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation (Current)**
- Merged traditional guides into enhanced docs/
- Created comprehensive development guides
- Established clear decision matrices
- Centralized universal requirements

## 🔄 Cleanup Actions Completed

### **Phase 1: Initial Architecture Cleanup**
1. ✅ Created `legacy/` directory with documentation
2. ✅ Moved legacy scripts to `legacy/` directory
3. ✅ Fixed directory naming: `components/monitors/` → `components/Monitors/`
4. ✅ Removed empty directories: `components/installations/`, `components/maintenance/`

### **Phase 2: Traditional Guides Migration**
1. ✅ Created `traditional-guides/` directory
2. ✅ Moved traditional development guides to `traditional-guides/`
3. ✅ Preserved all valuable content for reference

### **Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation**
1. ✅ Merged traditional guides into enhanced `docs/` structure
2. ✅ Created comprehensive development guides
3. ✅ Removed `traditional-guides/` directory after successful merge
4. ✅ Updated all cross-references and navigation
