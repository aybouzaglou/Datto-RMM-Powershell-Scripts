### Component Configuration and Security

When creating a new component in Datto RMM, configuring its metadata correctly is the first step toward building a maintainable and secure automation library .

*   **Naming and Description**: Use a clear, descriptive name and a detailed description for each component. This helps other technicians understand its purpose without reading the code .
*   **Component Level**: This setting is a critical security feature that controls which users can view, edit, or execute the component. A user's security level must be equal to or higher than the component's level to access it. For example, a user with a "Medium" level can only access components set to "Medium", "Low", or "Basic" .
*   **Category**: Assigning a category (e.g., Applications, Monitors, Scripts) helps organize the Component Library for easier navigation .

### Mastering Input Variables

Input variables are fundamental to creating flexible and reusable components, preventing the need for hard-coded values and the duplication of scripts [1].

*   **How They Work**: Datto RMM sets component variables as environment variables on the endpoint at runtime. This means that even if a script file is inspected on a local machine, sensitive information is not directly visible within the script's code [1].
*   **Calling Variables in Scripts**: The method for calling a variable depends on the scripting language. For PowerShell, variables must be explicitly referenced as environment variables using the `$env:` prefix (e.g., `$env:exampleVariable`) [1].
*   **Variable Types**: Choosing the correct variable type simplifies the user experience and reduces input errors during job configuration [1].

| Variable Type | Description | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **String** | A free-text field for arbitrary data. It has a character limit of 20,000 [1]. | Service names, user names, file paths, or other unique identifiers [1]. |
| **Selection** | Creates a multiple-choice list. The user sees a "Display Name," which maps to a specific "Value" passed to the script [1]. | Restricting choices to a predefined set of options, such as `Install`, `Uninstall`, or `Repair` [1]. |
| **Date** | Provides a calendar interface for date selection, ensuring a standardized date format [1]. | Scripts that require a specific date, especially across different geographical regions with varying date formats [1]. |
| **Boolean** | A simple True/False selection. In PowerShell, this is passed as a string (`"true"` or `"false"`) and must be evaluated as such, not as a native PowerShell `$true`/`$false` variable [1]. | Enabling or disabling specific features within a script, like a debug mode or a forced reboot [1]. |

A common mistake in PowerShell is testing a Boolean variable's existence instead of its string value. Because Datto RMM always defines the variable, you must check its content [1].

**Correct PowerShell Boolean Handling:**
```powershell
if ($env:exampleVariable -eq 'true') {
    write-host "Example variable was set to true"
} else {
    write-host "Example variable was not set to true"
}
```

### Writing Modular Code with Functions

Using functions is essential for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. It packages blocks of code that can be run multiple times, which simplifies script maintenance and readability [2].

*   **Simple Functions**: For repetitive tasks like logging error messages, a simple function can be called whenever needed, reducing code duplication [2].
    ```powershell
    function quitMsg {
        echo "[ERROR] The script could not complete."
        echo "Please review the logs for more details."
    }
    # To call the function:
    quitMsg
    ```
*   **Functions with Arguments**: To make functions more dynamic, pass arguments to them. In PowerShell, arguments are defined in the function declaration. When passing arguments that contain spaces, always enclose them in quotes [2].
    ```powershell
    function displayData($data1, $data2) {
        write-host "Data: $data1 $data2"
    }
    # To call the function:
    displayData "The start time is:" "10:00AM"
    ```
*   **Returning Data from Functions**: Functions can perform calculations or operations and return the result to the main script. This is useful for on-the-fly calculations [2].
    ```powershell
    function toFahrenheit($temperature) {
        return (1.8 * $temperature + 32)
    }
    
    $result = toFahrenheit 30
    write-host "30 degrees C is $result in F" 
    ```

### Advanced String Manipulation

Scripts often need to extract specific information from a larger string, such as a user ID from a block of text pasted into an input variable. The `.split()` method in PowerShell is highly effective for this [2].

For example, if a user pastes `Hi, your code is usr12345! Be careful.` into a variable, you can extract the code:

```powershell
# User input stored in an environment variable
$userInput = $env:pastedText 

# Split the string by spaces and select the 5th element (index 4)
$userCode = $userInput.split(' ')[4] 

# $userCode now contains "usr12345!"
```
This approach is more robust than asking users to manually extract the information, reducing potential errors [2].

# Datto RMM Script Architecture: Tailored Best Practices by Script Type

You're absolutely right that different types of Datto RMM scripts require fundamentally different approaches. The three main categories—installation, removal/modification, and monitor scripts—each have distinct requirements, structures, and best practices that must be understood to create effective automation components.

## Understanding the Three Script Categories

Datto RMM scripts fall into three primary categories, each with unique characteristics and requirements. Installation scripts focus on deploying software and services safely and reliably. Removal and modification scripts prioritize safety, backups, and clean system state management. Monitor scripts emphasize speed, clarity, and consistent alerting for system health checks[1][2].
## Installation Scripts: Deploy and Configure

### Core Approach
Installation scripts are the most complex type, requiring comprehensive pre-flight checks, detailed logging, and thorough verification processes. These scripts typically run under SYSTEM context and may take 30-60 minutes to complete, depending on the software being deployed[1][2].

### Essential Structure Elements
Every installation script should begin with detailed transcript logging using `Start-Transcript` to capture all installation activities. The script must include prerequisite checks for operating system compatibility, available disk space, existing installations, and required dependencies. File integrity verification through hash validation is critical before executing any installation commands[1][2].

### Key Variables and Parameters
Installation scripts benefit from flexible input variables including installer paths, installation parameters, license keys (using secure variables), configuration files, and boolean flags for reinstallation scenarios. Selection variables work well for installation types (Full, Custom, Minimal) and architecture choices (x86, x64, ARM)[1][2].

### Exit Code Strategy
Installation scripts should use a clear exit code hierarchy: 0 for successful installation, 1 for completion with warnings, 2 for general installation failures, 3 for insufficient privileges, 4 for unmet prerequisites, and 5 for existing installation conflicts when not forcing reinstallation[1][2].
## Removal and Modification Scripts: Safe System Changes

### Safety-First Philosophy
Removal and modification scripts require a fundamentally different approach focused on system safety and data preservation. These scripts must always check current system state, provide backup options, and implement graceful degradation for partial failures[1][2].

### Critical Pre-Flight Checks
Before any removal or modification operation, scripts must verify software installation status, check for running services and processes, identify dependent applications, and create configuration backups when requested. This prevents destructive operations on systems that don't match expected states[1][2].

### Backup and Recovery Strategies
Every removal script should offer configuration backup options through input variables like `$env:BackupConfiguration`. The script should stop related services before attempting removal, use proper uninstall methods (MSI, Control Panel, native uninstaller), and verify complete removal before reporting success[1][2].

### Exit Code Framework
Removal scripts use similar exit codes but with different meanings: 0 for successful removal, 1 for completion with warnings about remaining components, 2 for general operation failures, 3 for software not found, 4 for software in use or locked, and 5 for insufficient privileges[1][2].
## Monitor Scripts: Fast and Clear Health Checks

### Fundamental Differences
Monitor scripts operate under completely different principles than installation or removal scripts. They must execute quickly (under 30 seconds), provide clear and actionable output, and avoid transcript logging to keep dashboard output clean[1][2].

### Speed and Simplicity Requirements
Monitor scripts should run under CURRENT_USER context when possible, avoiding the overhead of SYSTEM privileges. They must collect metrics efficiently, compare against thresholds quickly, and generate clear status messages without complex processing workflows[1][2].

### Output and Alerting Strategy
Monitor scripts use `Write-Host` for maximum visibility in the RMM dashboard, including relevant metrics in the output. The exit code strategy is different: 0 for healthy/normal conditions, 1 for warning conditions, 2 for critical conditions, and 3 for monitor script errors when status cannot be determined[1][2].

### Threshold Management
Effective monitor scripts use input variables for warning and critical thresholds, alert-on-change flags, and metric type specifications. They must handle edge cases gracefully, such as missing services or network failures, without generating false alarms[1][2].
## Decision Framework for Script Type Selection

Choosing the correct script type depends on your specific automation goal. The decision process can be simplified into three main categories of actions you need to perform.
When you need to deploy, install, or configure something new, use installation scripts. These handle software deployment, configuration deployment, service setup, and system configuration tasks. When you need to remove, uninstall, or modify existing systems, use removal/modification scripts for software uninstallation, settings changes, configuration updates, and system state modifications.

For checking, monitoring, or validating system conditions, use monitor scripts. These excel at health monitoring, compliance checking, threshold alerting, and status validation tasks.

## Component Configuration Considerations

### Installation Scripts Configuration
Installation scripts should be categorized as "Applications" with Medium to High component levels based on security requirements. They typically require SYSTEM run context and timeouts of 30-60 minutes depending on the software complexity[1][2].

### Removal/Modification Scripts Configuration
These scripts belong in the "Scripts" category with Medium to High component levels. They also require SYSTEM context but generally need shorter timeouts of 15-30 minutes since removal operations are typically faster than installations[1][2].

### Monitor Scripts Configuration
Monitor scripts should be categorized as "Monitors" with Low to Medium component levels. They often work effectively with CURRENT_USER context and should have strict timeouts of 5-10 minutes maximum to prevent dashboard delays[1][2].

## Testing Strategies by Script Type

### Installation Script Testing
Installation scripts require testing on clean systems, systems with existing installations, scenarios with insufficient disk space, locked file conditions, network connectivity failures, and various user permission levels. This comprehensive testing ensures reliability across diverse deployment environments[1][2].

### Removal Script Testing
Removal scripts need testing with software installed and not installed, running software scenarios, locked file conditions, corrupted installations, and backup/restore functionality verification. This ensures safe operation regardless of system state[1][2].

### Monitor Script Testing
Monitor scripts require testing across all condition states: normal, warning, critical, missing services or processes, network failures, and execution time under system load. This ensures reliable alerting across all operational scenarios[1][2].

## Key Implementation Principles

The most critical principle is matching your script structure, variables, and testing strategy to the specific type of script you're creating. Installation scripts should focus on reliability, prerequisites, and verification. Removal and modification scripts must prioritize safety, backups, and cleanup. Monitor scripts should emphasize speed, clarity, and consistent alerting[1][2].

Each script type serves a distinct purpose in the Datto RMM ecosystem, and understanding these differences is essential for creating effective automation components that integrate seamlessly with the platform's complete management capabilities.
