# Legacy Scripts Directory

This directory contains the original scripts from before the GitHub-based function library architecture was implemented.

## Legacy Scripts

These scripts are preserved for:
- Backward compatibility
- Reference purposes
- Users who prefer traditional approaches
- Historical context

## Migration Path

For each legacy script, there is now an enhanced version in the new architecture:

- `DattoRMM-FocusedDebloat-Launcher.ps1` → Use `launchers/LaunchScripts.ps1` with `ScriptName="FocusedDebloat.ps1"`
- `FocusedDebloat.ps1` → Enhanced version at `components/Scripts/FocusedDebloat.ps1`
- `Scansnap.ps1` → Enhanced version at `components/Applications/ScanSnapHome.ps1`

## Recommendation

**New deployments should use the GitHub-based function library architecture** for:
- Auto-updating scripts
- Enhanced error handling
- Shared function library
- Better logging and debugging
- Enterprise-grade features
