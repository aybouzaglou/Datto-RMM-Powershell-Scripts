# Legacy Scripts Directory

This directory contains the original scripts from before the GitHub-based function library architecture was implemented.

## Legacy Scripts and Tools

These scripts and tools are preserved for:
- Backward compatibility
- Reference purposes
- Users who prefer traditional approaches
- Historical context

## Contents

### PowerShell Scripts
- `DattoRMM-FocusedDebloat-Launcher.ps1` - Original launcher for debloat script
- `FocusedDebloat.ps1` - Original Windows debloat script
- `Scansnap.ps1` - Original ScanSnap installation script
- `.netrepair tool.ps1` - .NET Framework repair utility

### Migration Path

For each legacy script, there is now an enhanced version in the new architecture:

- `DattoRMM-FocusedDebloat-Launcher.ps1` → Use `launchers/LaunchScripts.ps1` with `ScriptName="FocusedDebloat.ps1"`
- `FocusedDebloat.ps1` → Enhanced version at `components/Scripts/FocusedDebloat.ps1`
- `Scansnap.ps1` → Enhanced version at `components/Applications/ScanSnapHome.ps1`
- `.netrepair tool.ps1` → Consider creating enhanced version in `components/Scripts/` if needed

## Recommendation

**New deployments should use the GitHub-based function library architecture** for:
- Auto-updating scripts
- Enhanced error handling
- Shared function library
- Better logging and debugging
- Enterprise-grade features
