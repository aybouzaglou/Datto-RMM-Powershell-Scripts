# Quick API Deployment Script for Datto RMM
# Simplified script to get you started with API-based deployment

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Quick deployment of test device setup using Datto RMM API
.DESCRIPTION
    Simplified script to deploy the test device setup component using the Datto RMM API.
    This gets you started with API-based deployment without complex error handling.
.PARAMETER ApiKey
    Your Datto RMM API key
.PARAMETER ApiSecret  
    Your Datto RMM API secret
.PARAMETER TestDeviceId
    Device ID of your Windows VM (find this in RMM console URL)
.EXAMPLE
    .\quick-api-deploy.ps1 -ApiKey "your-key" -ApiSecret "your-secret" -TestDeviceId "12345"
.NOTES
    This is a simplified version to get started. Use the full deploy-test-device-api.ps1 for production.
