    .PARAMETER ComponentType
        Type of component: Monitor, Application, or Script

    .PARAMETER PerformanceRequirement
        Maximum acceptable execution time in milliseconds
        
    .PARAMETER ReliabilityLevel
        Required reliability level: Critical, Standard, Low
        
    .PARAMETER ComplexityLevel
        Component complexity: Simple, Standard, Complex
