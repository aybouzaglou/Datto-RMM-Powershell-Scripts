.SYNOPSIS
Quick Test - Datto RMM Environment Variable Inheritance

.DESCRIPTION
Simple test to verify that the hard-coded launcher approach will work with Datto RMM
by testing environment variable inheritance in the exact same pattern.

.EXAMPLE
.\Test-DattoRMM-EnvVars.ps1

.NOTES
This test simulates:
1. Datto RMM setting environment variables
2. Hard-coded launcher downloading and executing a script
3. Downloaded script accessing those environment variables
