.SYNOPSIS
    üéØ Deployment Decision Matrix Testing Suite

.DESCRIPTION
    Comprehensive testing suite that validates the deployment decision matrix logic
    for determining when to use direct deployment vs launcher-based deployment.
    
    Tests all decision criteria:
    - Component type (Monitors, Applications, Scripts)
    - Execution frequency (high-frequency vs standard)
    - Performance requirements (<200ms vs standard)
    - Reliability requirements (critical vs standard)
    - Complexity (simple vs multi-step)
    - Update frequency (frequent vs stable)

.PARAMETER TestLevel
    Level of testing to perform
    - Quick: Basic decision matrix validation
    - Full: Complete testing with edge cases
    - Comprehensive: Extended testing with performance validation

.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-DeploymentDecisionMatrix.ps1 -TestLevel Full
