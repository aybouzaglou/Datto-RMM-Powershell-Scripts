# Traditional Script Development Guides

This directory contains the original guides for traditional PowerShell script development in Datto RMM environments.

## Traditional Guides

These guides are preserved for:
- Learning PowerShell scripting fundamentals
- Understanding Datto RMM requirements and constraints
- Custom script development from scratch
- Users who prefer traditional approaches
- Educational and reference purposes

## Guide Contents

- `Quick-Reference.md` - Decision matrix and quick navigation for script types
- `Installation-Scripts-Guide.md` - Complete guide for software deployment scripts
- `Monitor-Scripts-Guide.md` - Performance-critical monitoring script guidance
- `Removal-Modification-Scripts-Guide.md` - Safe removal and modification practices

## Migration to New Architecture

**For new projects, consider using the GitHub-based function library architecture:**

- **Faster development** with shared functions
- **Auto-updating scripts** from GitHub
- **Enhanced error handling** and logging
- **Enterprise-grade features** like caching and timeout protection
- **Better maintainability** with version control

See the main [README.md](../README.md) and [Deployment Guide](../docs/Deployment-Guide.md) for the new architecture.

## When to Use Traditional Guides

- Learning PowerShell scripting concepts
- Understanding Datto RMM execution environment
- Developing highly customized scripts
- Working in air-gapped environments
- Educational purposes and training
